# etch-a-sketch
Live demo: https://mvivn.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

This project is an attempt to create a browser-based sketchpad/Etch-a-Sketch hybrid using the standard tools of the trade -- HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course and the objective is to put my newly-minted DOM manipulation skills to the test. I will update this README file periodically as I make progress with the project with links, resources, and lessons learned along the way.

<strong>Update Wednesday 17 August 2022</strong>

After <em>3 days</em> of working on this project, I think I'm ready to move on to the next lesson/project... for now. I will probably revisit this project again from time to time. I tried really hard to add functionality that would allow a user to only draw on the canvas when their mouse button is held down, but after several attempts and a lot of googling, I wasn't able to get it working. When I learn a bit more, I might come back to this project and see if I can figure out how to implement that. I also wasn't able to figure out a way to enable a "shading mode", wherein each mouseover event makes a selected square darker until it's completely black. It was one of the 'extra credit' challenges for this project and I wasn't able to do it. It's also worth mentioning that I had to re-write a significant portion of my code because I had initially tried, as a challenge to myself, to put every single visible element on the page using JavaScript DOM methods, but it resulted in a very bloated and confusing mess of a JS file (and it still is quite messy, even now), and I had a hard time getting some stuff to work right when styling the page because of this choice. I was able to rectify this by moving a lot of the divs and containers into the HTML file itself. I'm still struggling with CSS but I'm generally happy with how the project turned out, visually. It was another fantastic learning and I'm excited to take the lessons learned working on this project into the next one.
