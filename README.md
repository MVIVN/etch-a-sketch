# etch-a-sketch
This project is an attempt to create a browser-based sketchpad/Etch-a-Sketch hybrid using the standard tools of the trade -- HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course and the objective is to put my newly-minted DOM manipulation skills to the test. I will update this README file periodically as I make progress with the project with links, resources, and lessons learned along the way.
